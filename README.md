# Exercise-2-Randomness-Test
In a lottery game, there is a container that contains 50 balls numbered from 1 to 50. The lottery game consists in picking 10 balls out of the container and ordering them in ascending order.
Write a Python function that generates the output of a lottery game (it should return a list). Also, describe which unit tests you could implement to test the output of your function.

Unit tests I could implement
1. test to see if the output is between 1-50 and actually 10 numbers
2. test if the result is return in list format and in ascending order
